Welcome to my website! My name is Nouran Abdelfattah and I am a Ph.D. student in the [Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/bbs/) graduate program at Harvard Medical School. I work in the Department of Genetics, in the lab of [Dr. Stephen Elledge](https://elledge.hms.harvard.edu/), on engineering T-cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity.
